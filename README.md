# R-METM-Standard
The Regulated-METM token standard falls into the emerging category of permissioned tokens.  The Regulated-METM standard adheres to the ERC201 interface allowing our tokens to be listed on any platform that supports ERC-20 tokens.  In the same contract it also provides the need for compliance on deployment and transfers of these tokens representing traditional assets.

The Regulated-METM Standard consists of 3 contract addresses. 
1. The Regulated-METM Token Contract (ERC20), 
2. The Metamorph Token Regulator, and 
3. The MetaMorph Regulator Registry (ability to upgrade Regulator).
